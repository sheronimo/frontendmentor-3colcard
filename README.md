## Overview

Hi! This is my attempt at the 3-Column preview card component challenge.

I decided to make some major changes to my approach compared to previous challenges, and I went for a mobile-first approach overall.

I initially considered setting the breakpoint for the grid at 768px, but I found each card still a little too narrow for my liking, and found it looking better at 1024px and above.

## My process

1. I went for a mobile-first approach, styling the columns as they appeared vertically first.
2. Only after fine-tuning the spacing and layout of the components to match the design images as much as possible did I then work on media queries for larger screens.
3. For the styling, I used SASS and attempted to modularise my structure into a main file and partials for: variables and media queries.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Grid

### What I learned

I learned how to tackle a mobile-first approach to styling and positioning components; typically I've always worked on large screens first and then worked my way down from there.
